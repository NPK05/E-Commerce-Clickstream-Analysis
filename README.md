# E-Commerce-Clickstream-Analysis
Churn prediction, anomaly detection &amp; behavior analysis

🛍️ E-Commerce Clickstream Analysis
A full-stack data science project to analyze user behavior on an e-commerce platform. It tracks funnel stages, predicts churn, detects anomalies, segments customers, and recommends products—all tied together with a custom-built dashboard.
📂 Dataset
The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle's E-Commerce Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mervemenekse/ecommerce-dataset).  
It contains transactional clickstream logs like login, product view, cart addition, and purchase.
## 🧠 Strategy and Business Mapping
Business logic (e.g., churn tagging, loyalty classification, win-back targeting) was derived from the `Marketing_Action` Excel file provided. We:
- Mapped action labels like "Win-Back", "At-Risk", and "Loyal" to churn status
- Grouped customer behavior for segmentation and targeting
- Used this to drive both modeling and dashboard segmentation

📊 **Interactive Dashboard – Built from Scratch**
No AI builders or BI tools like Power BI/Tableau were used.
🛠️ Built with:
- Streamlit for frontend layout
- Plotly & Seaborn for visuals
- Pandas for data manipulation

📌 [Dashboard Codebase → `ecommerce_dashboard_app.py`](ecommerce_dashboard_app.py)
> The entire dashboard layout, interaction logic, data caching, and export functionality was authored manually in Python.
